# HexTechMover
A Tier II Remotely Controlled Car Built Using the HexTech v1 Circuit Board.

## Quick Explanation
After finishing the Automatic Wire Cutter, I wanted to make something from scratch with the HexTech board. I decided that a car would be an awesome idea because it was simple enough for me to do and yet challenging enough to teach me more about engineering.

The way it works is really simple. A stepper motor for each wheel is attached to a keyed rod with the wheel on it. It's a bit more complicated than that, but that's the basic idea.

## Challenges
The idea is simple, but actually doing involved a lot more steps than I had planned. Because I wanted the car to be capable of carrying a heavy load, I needed to attach attach the wheels to flange. If I wanted it to be strong, I couldn't just 3D print a flange, so I had to make use of a plasma cutter to cut strong sheets of metal into the shapes I needed. 

After the long process of learning how to use the plasma cutter, smoothing the sharp edges, 3D printing the rest of my parts, and screwing the components onto a board, I ended up with a moving car, but it couldn't steer. Of course I could move the left wheels forward and back wheels backward for rotation, but that would produce a lot of friction unless the wheels were mounted on a square body. The solution to this was to 3D print tires to increase traction.

With that, my project was finally done and I had finally built a fully functional remote-controlled car from scratch with the HexTech board.
